# hello_data_science
I've summarised some of the projects and code I've worked on around data analyst, machine learning, time series analysis and AI. I you have any question, just text me.

<p> On "Data_Science\projet_spaceY" is a data science Projet. In this Projet, we  predict if the Falcon 9 first stage(a rocket) will land successfully or not. More Informations about the scenario are under projet_spaceY\README.md</p>
<br>

<p> on "Data_Science\data_visualisation" use folium to plot geospatialdata and dash to create web application with interactive dashboard with plotly
</p>

<br>
<p> on "Data_Science\data_analysis" I do some data collection, preparation and preprocessing of a dataset. In the same module, under "model_development", I train some machine learning model an the dataset such as Multiple Linear Regression and evaluate it with the help of distribution plots  </p>

<br>

<p> On "machine_learning" I train some machine learning algorithms </p>
